"""Structured progress reporting.

The console UI learns what is happening from print statements. The local gui server needs
the same information as data - page counts for a progress bar, rate limit pauses to show
as a warning - so the pieces that know about those emit an event as well as printing one.

Callers that pass nothing (the whole command line app) get exactly the old behaviour.
