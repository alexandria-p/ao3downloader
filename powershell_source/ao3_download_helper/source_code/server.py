"""A local helper that lets the web ui run downloads.

A browser cannot reach ao3 (no CORS headers), cannot hold an ao3 login session, and cannot
read the ebook files on disk that the update scan needs. So the page asks this instead, and
this calls the same code the console menu calls.

By default it listens on the loopback interface only, so nothing outside this machine can
reach it, and it holds the ao3 password just long enough to log in - it is never written
anywhere. It can also be hosted on a server for one person's own use, and then it answers
nobody without a passcode and takes the login only encrypted - see `access.py`.
