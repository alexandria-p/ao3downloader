"""Updating the Windows or Mac app from inside itself: the page's **Update now**.

Only the packaged app can do this (`desktop.py` sets `Handler.updater`) - it is the one copy
that is a folder of files on someone's computer, installed from a GitHub release. A helper run
any other way answers the update endpoints 404, and its page never shows the button.

What happens, in order:

1. `latest` asks GitHub for the repository's latest release and finds this app's zip -
   `ao3downloader-windows.zip`, or on a Mac the one for its chip. It has to be newer than this
   app, or nothing happens.
2. `install` downloads it into `update/` beside the program and checks it: against the SHA-256
   GitHub publishes for the file, and entry by entry - every file has to land inside the
   app's own folder (a symlink too, wherever it points), and the zip has to hold the program
   and its `_internal/`. Anything wrong and nothing is touched.
3. It unpacks it into `update/new/` - keeping each file's permissions and each symlink, which
   the Mac app needs - writes the swap script, starts it detached, and closes the app.
4. The script waits for the app to be gone, moves each top-level item of the old app into
   `update/previous/` and the new one in its place, and starts the app again. If a move fails
   it puts every old item back first, so the app that starts is always a whole one - the new
   version, or the old one it was. It writes what it did to `update/update.log`, which the
   restarted app reads (`last_result`) so the page can say an update failed.

The swap is PowerShell on Windows (`SWAP_SCRIPT`) and bash on a Mac (`MAC_SWAP_SCRIPT`), and
the two write the same log lines. On a Mac the app lives in a Terminal window, so the script
starts it again by opening `Start ao3downloader.command` in a new one.

`config/` and `logs/` are never moved: they are not in the zip, and the script skips them by
name as well. So an update never touches the user's settings.ini - the restarted app adds any
new setting to it, and comments out any the new version dropped (`desktop.settings_up_to_date`).
