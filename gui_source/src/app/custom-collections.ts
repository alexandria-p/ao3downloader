 * **They live in `collections/custom/`, and the helper never sees them.** Every helper read
 * of `collections/` lists that folder's own files only, never a folder inside it - so a
 * custom collection is not linked into works' `from_collections`, not counted by the
 * new-bookmarks walk, and cannot be overwritten by a collection run of the same name. The
 * page reads the whole folder and tells collections from works by shape, so it finds them.
 *
 * **A name that can never be an ao3 one.** ao3 collection names are letters, digits and
 * underscores, so a custom collection's `custom-` prefix keeps the two apart for good. The
 * name is the file's name too, so renaming the title later moves nothing.
 *
 * Works from ao3 collections are never changed here: what ao3 says a collection holds is
 * ao3's to say, and the next collection run would only put it back.
